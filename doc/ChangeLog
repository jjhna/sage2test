From 'april2017' to 'HEAD'
--------------------------

New
~~~
- Reset (to 1) the desktop window scaling inside electron. It should
  help especially for Windows users with scaling over 100%. [Luc
  Renambot]
- Adding ChangeLog files, from begining to v1, from v1 to v2, and v2 to
  april2017 (made usinggitchangelog) [Luc Renambot]

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Updated node versions for binary node modules (node-demux) [Luc
  Renambot]
- Updating to node v8.x for Windows build. [Luc Renambot]
- Adding user forum link in the help menu and the links page. [Luc
  Renambot]
- Update pdf library to pdfjs-1.7.225. [Luc Renambot]
- Added an option to build ChangeLog into the 'doc' folder. [Luc
  Renambot]
- Replaced CAVE2 by sage2server.evl.uic.edu as example of remote sites
  in default sabi.js configuration for SAGE2 server (we get a lot of
  requests to CAVE2) [Luc Renambot]
- Add the code documentation to the preload function. [Luc Renambot]
- Moved older ChangeLog files into 'doc' folder. [Luc Renambot]

Fix
~~~
- Better handle malformed URLs to access files outside the SAGE2
  folders. [Luc Renambot]
- Fixes issue #96 by having sabi launch using the host in the config
  file. This will require a recopy of the launch script. Easiest way to
  do this is delete the SAGE2_Media\sabiConfig folder and relaunch sabi
  to have it copy the files over automatically. The bat file was
  additive, so it will not break previous installations if they upgrade.
  But the image download error will remain until the bat file gets
  replaced. [D K]
- Sabi visual adjustments and the incorrect update button. [D K]
- Reset desktop window scaling only on Windows (macos does the right
  thing) [Luc Renambot]
- Update client electron file from the master. [Luc Renambot]
- New npm v5 doesnt like the indentation in package.json. [Luc Renambot]
- Fix undefined Access-Control-Allow-Origin in the server (exposed by
  node v8.0) [Luc Renambot]
- Small fix to an outgoing WS message from sticky note code to prevent
  circular JSON (addresses #94) [Andrew Burks]
- On mobile, set 'click' to open menus in media browser. [Luc Renambot]
- Add a few more reserved characters to sanitize filenames. Should fix
  #91 hopefully. [Luc Renambot]
- Fixes issue #92 by staying in version 1 of socket.io. [Luc Renambot]
- Removed 'twit' package as dependency. [Luc Renambot]
- Check if we have a valid remote site definition before adding it. [Luc
  Renambot]
